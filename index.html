        <p class="bio">In only 2.5 years, I graduated with a 3.8 GPA and recieved a Bachelor of Arts in Communication
            and minor in Psychology from Texas A&M University. Following graduation I worked a temporary postion in
            Content at the Favor Delivery Headquarters in Austin, TX until I moved into a more permanent position as
            Business Development Representative at LogicMonitor. While doing outbound sales for a software company can
            be interesting, I wanted to pursue more technical roles and learn software and web developement with the
            hopes of becoming an engineer. While continuing my full time job as a BDR, I have also enrolled in a coding
            bootcamp at the University of Texas, where I am learning full-stack development. After graduation in April
            2020, I hope to gain a more technical position in development/engineering. </p>
